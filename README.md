# safevault-secure-backup
SafeVault is a cloud-inspired secure file backup and restore web app built using the MERN stack. It simulates key concepts of data protection including versioned backup, tamper detection via checksums, and audit logging. This project is inspired by Druvaâ€™s mission to deliver resilient and secure cloud data management.
